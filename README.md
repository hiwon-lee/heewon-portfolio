# heewon-portfolio

이 reposity가 무엇인지 설명하겠습니다..

2021년 11월 인턴 지원을 하기 위해서 vanilla javascript로 하루만에 뚝딱뚝딱 만들어버린 프로젝트랍니다

레전드 끔찍한 스파게티 코드였습니다.. 심지어 에러 파티였는데, 어째서인지 실행은 되는 놀라운 코드였습니다..



그리고 2024년 8월, 약 3년이라는 시간이 흐르고 급하게 포트폴리오가 필요했고 vanilla JS -> React로 리팩토링했습니다.


이러한 이유로

- 컴퍼넌트 활용도가 낮다는 점
- 하드코딩의 흔적이 남아있다는 점
- `my-app` 폴더로 들어가야 진짜 코드를 활용할 수 있다는 점

서론이 다소 길고 진부했지만, 그래서 저의 결론은 **이 repo는 아주 날 것의 repo라는 것입니다.**
- 추가로 여전히 리팩토링 진행중입니다..
- 이 레포에 국한해서 리팩토링은 아마 쭉 이어질 듯

```cmd
// 해당 레포 클론
git clone https://github.com/hiwon-lee/heewon-portfolio

// my-app 폴더로 이동
cd my-app

// 레포 기본 모듈 설치
npm install
npm install styled-components

// 프로젝트 실행
npm start

// 프로젝트 재배포
npm run deploy
// 이건 마음대로하면 진짜 죽어
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
